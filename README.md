# von_mises_EM

- Von-mises distribution with EM algorithm 

This code demonstrates EM Algorithm for circular data. 

Normally, Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm example employs a Gaussian distribution.
However, in this example, I employed a Von-mises distribution to EM algorithm.
EM algorithm will cluster circular data as below.

See p.106 in the text book Pattern Recognition and Machine learning by Christoper Bishop for more information about Von-mises distribution.


In this example, I used audio data that are panned between multiple audio channels.
